# LifeCounter
I made this app during my formation to get comfortable qith the Java langage.

This app was made to allow two people to keep a track of their Life points when playing the board-game Magic The Gathering.
It as a simple counter for both player, a button to reinitialize the points, a button to select the number of life point in the beginning and a last button to decide wich Player
will begin First.
